# odin-javascript-todo-list
Github repository for the ToDo List project in the Odin Project's JavaScript Course

This project was a lot of fun and focused on many different areas of JavaScript and CSS. 
Primarily, the focus of this project was on Object-Oriented-Programming principles, following the SOLID principles and especially focusing on the Single Responsibility Principle. 

I was also focused on trying to write reusable code components for different aspects of the page layout, such as the sidebar and the the project view. This made the code easier to interpret and see the relationships between the different files. 

ES6 modules were used heavily, with named and default exports being used depending on the context. 
This was also a great way to practice using JavaScript to dynamically render the DOM. 
Additionally, I gained a deeper understanding of CSS through extensive use of Flexbox and Grid to make complex layouts. 

I also was able to get more practice with webpack and npm, as I had to configure webpack to generate the HTML file, bundle javascript code, and load different assets. I used npm to install the loaders as well as the date-fns library, which was useful for formatting and storing and working with dates. 
Overall, this was a fun project from start to finish and I believe that I learned a lot over the course of working on this. 

The final aspect of this project was to allow data persistence through the use of the Web Storage API.
